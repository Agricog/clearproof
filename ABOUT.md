# ClearProof — Product Summary

## What It Is

A multilingual health & safety comprehension verification platform for construction, manufacturing, and logistics industries.

---

## The Problem It Solves

**Current situation:** Site managers distribute safety documents (RAMS, inductions, method statements) and workers sign to say they've "read and understood" — but there's no proof they actually understood the content.

This creates:

- **HSE compliance risk** — Can't prove comprehension in an incident investigation
- **Language barriers** — Diverse workforce, documents only in English
- **Tick-box culture** — Signatures are meaningless
- **Audit vulnerability** — No evidence trail

---

## How ClearProof Works

1. **Upload** — Manager uploads safety document (PDF/TXT)
2. **AI Transform** — Claude simplifies complex content into plain language
3. **Translate** — Auto-translated into 10+ languages (Polish, Romanian, Portuguese, Ukrainian, etc.)
4. **QR Code** — Generated for the module, printed on-site
5. **Worker Verification** — Worker scans QR, reads simplified content in their language, answers scenario-based comprehension questions
6. **Audit Trail** — Full record: who, when, what score, IP address, answers given
